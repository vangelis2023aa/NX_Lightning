# FAQ

#### **Where's the prod.keys file?/Where can I download \[game]?**
**We do not support piracy**, It is forbidden to request copyrighted content 
(Firmware/Games/Keys/Shaders) on our repositories or on the MeloNX Discord.

#### **Do I need a Switch to use this emulator?**
MeloNX emulator is capable of running many homebrew applications, and can be a crucial tool in the development and debugging of homebrew applications and games. To play commercial games, you will need access to a Switch compatible with custom firmware (CFW), which will enable you to dump your system firmware, keys and legally purchased games.

#### **How can I dump my firmware/games/keys?**
First, you need to hack your Nintendo Switch, which you can learn how to do here: [https://nh-server.github.io/switch-guide/](https://nh-server.github.io/switch-guide/).

Once you have hacked your Switch, backed up your keys and dumped your firmware, you may follow these guides to dump keys, updates and DLC, firmware and games:

[Keys](https://docs.ryujinx.app/guides/dumping/keys/)<br>
[Games, Updates and DLC](https://docs.ryujinx.app/guides/dumping/game-content/)<br>
[Firmware](https://docs.ryujinx.app/guides/dumping/fw/)

# Info

- MeloNX **REQUIRES** JIT and CANNOT run without it.
- Recommended iPhone: iPhone 15 Pro+ (8/12GB RAM both have the same memory limit of 6GB)
- Recommended iPad: iPad Pro 5th+ 128GB+ (8GB RAM) / 1TB+ (16GB RAM) or iPad Air 5+ (8GB RAM)
- Lowest Compatible Device (Paid Developer Account): iPhone 6s (iOS 15)

# Entitlements

> **Entitlements** are the underlying security permissions that allow an app to access specific features of your device

MeloNX can use **2** Entitlements:

**Increased Memory Limit:**<br>
\- This allows MeloNX to be able to use the most amount of ram apple lets us.

**Extended Virtual Addressing**:<br>
\- This allows MeloNX to be able to ask iOS for more memory / RAM then actually available.<br>
\- Extended Virtual Addressing is a **PAID** entitlement, [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore) also gives this entitlement.

Increased Memory Limit is required for **all devices**.

Extended Virtual Addressing is required for *specific devices* which don't allow us to ask the RAM we need without the Extended Virtual Addressing entitlement.

Those Devices include:<br>
iPads with less than 8GB of RAM.<br>
iPhones with less than 4GB of RAM.

## How to install

### Recommended Guide (Plumeimpactor)

> [SideStore](https://sidestore.io/) is recommended (optional) for an on-device Sideloader, and should be installed prior performing this install.

#### **Make sure to read the FAQ and Info before continuing.**

#### 1. Sideload Application
Download and install MeloNX using [PlumeImpactor](https://github.com/claration/Impactor/releases) on a computer.
- [Download **MeloNX** From Releases](https://git.ryujinx.app/projects/MeloNX/releases)

- Login with the same Apple ID you are using for SideStore (or AltStore).
- Import the MeloNX .ipa you downloaded earlier.
- Plug in your iDevice.
- Select your iDevice from the dropdown at the top of the window.

#### 2. Load Into SideStore (Optional)
To have MeloNX show inside SideStore (or AltStore), You must re-install it:
- Open **SideStore** on your iDevice
- Select the **My Apps** tab > Tap the **+** button.
- Select the **MeloNX** .ipa (You may need to download it again.)
- Wait for it to Sideload, then it should show up Inside **SideStore**.
- Now You can Refresh **MeloNX** and Update it without needing a computer.

#### 4. Setup Files
- Add Encryption Keys and Firmware using the file picker inside MeloNX,
- Information for where to get these files are [here](#how-can-i-dump-my-firmwaregameskeys)

#### 5. Enable JIT
- Enable JIT using your preferred method, on iOS 26 [StikDebug](https://github.com/StephenDev0/StikDebug) is required.

#### 2. Enable Memory Entitlement
- Visit [Apple Developer Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers).
- Locate **MeloNX** and enable the following entitlements:
- `Increased Memory Limit`
- `Extended Virtual Addressing`
- `Increased Debugging Memory Limit`

#### 3. Reinstall MeloNX
- Delete existing MeloNX installation

## Features

\- **Audio**<br>
Audio output is entirely supported, audio input (microphone) isn't supported.
We use C# wrappers for [OpenAL](https://openal-soft.org/), and [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) & [libsoundio](http://libsound.io/) as fallbacks.


\- **CPU**<br>
The CPU emulator, ARMeilleure, emulates an ARMv8 CPU and currently has support for most 64-bit ARMv8 and some of the ARMv7 (and older) instructions, including partial 32-bit support.
It translates the ARM code to a custom IR, performs a few optimizations, and turns that into x86 code.
There are three memory manager options available depending on the user's preference, leveraging both software-based (slower) and host-mapped modes (much faster).
The fastest option (host, unchecked) is set by default.
Ryujinx also features an optional Profiled Persistent Translation Cache, which essentially caches translated functions so that they do not need to be translated every time the game loads.
The net result is a significant reduction in load times (the amount of time between launching a game and arriving at the title screen) for nearly every game.
NOTE: This feature is enabled by default, You must launch the game at least twice to the title screen or beyond before performance improvements are unlocked on the third launch!
These improvements are permanent and do not require any extra launches going forward.


\- **GPU**<br>
The GPU emulator emulates the Switch's Maxwell GPU using Metal (via MoltenVK) APIs through a custom build of Silk.NET.


\- **Input**<br>
We currently have support for keyboard, touch input, JoyCon input support, and nearly all MFI controllers.

Motion controls are natively supported in most cases, however JoyCons do not have motion support due to an iOS limitation.

Rumble is also natively supported in most cases.


\- **DLC & Modifications**<br>
MeloNX supports DLC + Game Update Add-ons.<br>
Mods (romfs, exefs, and runtime mods such as cheats) are unsupported; but may work. 


\- **Configuration**<br>
The emulator has settings for enabling or disabling logging, remapping controllers, resolution settings, Shader Cache and more.
